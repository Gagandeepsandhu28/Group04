Make-My-Food system is a web-based application that enables customers to order their pizza online for home delivery or pick up from the pizzeria. The problem with the existing system is you must have ordered your pizzas on the phone for home delivery. The process seems easy to use, but at times there is miscommunication. As there is no visual menu shown during a phone call, the employees have to repeat a lot of things again and again to the customers. It’s a time-consuming process which at times, irritates customers. Also, it takes a lot of time for the pizzeria staff. 
           It would be much more comfortable for the customers having an online pizza ordering system. It would be hassle-free for users as they can select the pizzas they want and make payment for it. Also, it will reduce the purchasing time for customers. Let us look at another benefit of using this system. Suppose I go to a pizzeria and make an order. Even after ordering pizzas from their outlet, I have to wait at least 15 minutes for my order to be ready. 
 
 It would be much more convenient if pizzas were ordered using a website or any online system, and it will tell the customer the time by which the order will be ready for pickup at the counter. It would be great for the customer as it will eliminate the waiting time.

Constraints 
* Regulatory Polices 
It is a document that describes philosophy, principles and fundamental factors used by the system in its regulatory program. Regulatory documents are policies, standards, guides, notices, procedures and information documents support and provide information on legally enforceable instruments. These documents do not create those instruments. 
* Hardware Limitation 
System integration, the process of putting hardware, software and people related to the system together for making a system. It is done incrementally so that sub systems (modules) area integrated one at a time. 
Interface problem between sub system and actual system usually found at the stage of integration which causes the hardware limitation. 
* Interface to other Applications 
This constraint describes the application’s relationship to other systems. For example, Does the application is independent? 
This application does integrate different application to provide some of the user-friendly functions.
